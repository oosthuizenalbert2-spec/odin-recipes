    <p>This muffin recipe yields soft, fluffy muffins perfect for breakfast or a snack.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a muffin tin or line with paper muffin cups.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk together milk, vegetable oil, egg, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; the batter should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Fill the muffin cups about two-thirds full with batter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow muffins to cool in the tin for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
